        Everyone is struggling, even the most brilliant minds.
        I am not a genius; I will also be in difficult situations.
        Therefore, I must be able to deal with "failure."
        <br>
        It is common to make mistakes on the first attempt.
        Try again if something is not accomplished on the initial attempt.
        <br>
        Something may appear simple but be difficult to accomplish.
        Continue for as long as you desire.
        Do not erroneously conclude, "This is typically so simple."
        It happens to even the best ones too.
        Tell yourself that, for once, you will not become frustrated or give up because of difficulty.
